# Auto-formatting on CI

As part of our Continuous Integration (CI) we want to auto-format code whenever it's pushed to Github. This makes sure when somebody is viewing the changes, or diff, in a Pull Request, they'll only see the actual code changes that matter, and none of the formatting, or style differences.

- Project has format script that will update our code when run
- go edit file, and run format
- Have to remember to do it each time before opening a Pull Request
- We can setup GH actions to auto-format for us
- create new workflow called validate
- commit & push to github
- make change & push to github, see changes
- now we can be sure the github diff only shows the changes that matter, and no styling differences
- Added auto-code formatting as part of our Continuous Integration or CI
