Another easy win we can do is make sure our app always builds, and that we haven't broken anything. To build the app, we run `npm run build`, but this is pretty slow, and it's tedious to run every time, so we'll add this to CI instead.

```yaml
name: Validate

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18
      - run: npm i
      - run: npm run build

```

Now we'll know if our branch fails to build before merging it into **main**.
