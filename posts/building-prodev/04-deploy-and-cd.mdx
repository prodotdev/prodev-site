# Next.js Deploy & Setting Up Continuous Deployment (CD)

After pushing our Next.js app onto Github, we'll go into Vercel, and select 'Add New' > 'Project'.

Find our repository, give the project a name and click Deploy. It should take a second to run, and then we'll be given a deployment URL where our site can be accessed.

Deploying with Next.js on vercel means Continuous Deployment is set up automatically by default. This means any changes pushed to Github will automatically be deployed immediately.
