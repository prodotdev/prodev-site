## Starting a Next.js App

Use `npx` to create a new Next.js app, so make sure you have node, and npm installed. Next, run `npx create-next-app@latest`:

- Typescript - yes
- Source directory -yes
- App route - yes (important)
- Customize alias - no (use default `@`)


Run `npm run dev` to start site up. Confirm everything works by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. If everything worked, you should see the Next.js page.

### Adding .nvmrc

Add a `.nvmrc` file in the project root to tell other developers what node version is required for the app.

When a user has nvm installed, and opens a directory with an `.nvmrc`, they'll automatically download, and install the specified version. Making sure everybody is on the same node version is good practice because that could affect the package versions that you will install.

### Creating the project in Github

In github, create a new Repository, and copy the repo url.

![repo](https://github.com/prodotdev/prodev-site/assets/11449462/c76fdb65-052b-4ea4-8dc7-12f4fbacfec9)
We'll add the origin to git by running `git remote add origin git@github.com:prodotdev/prodev-site.git`, and push up our code by running `git push --set-upstream origin main`.
