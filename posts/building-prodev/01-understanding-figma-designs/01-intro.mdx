# Intro

Before you start writing code, you'll save yourself a lot of time if you try to
understand the overall design upfront.

## App pages, and components

Understanding how everything ties together can help you structure your code
better, and help you come up with more relevant naming conventions in your code.

## Common design conventions

Every app should have common design conventions for consistency. This would
cover things like spacing, colors, font-sizes, and button styles.

## Complex, or dynamic behavior

This is usually things like animations, visual effects, live editors, things
with unconventional UX. These things are difficult to understand fully from a
static design, and may leave out nuances that the designer, or product manager
intended.

It's helpful to try to understand these ahead of time, so you can judge their
complexity, prioritize, and scope correctly. If you see a complex animation,
reach out to your product, or project manager and ask 'Hey is it ok if I
implement this last?'

If you can prioritize, and reduce scope before you start writing code, you're
already half-way there.
