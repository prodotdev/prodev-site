Good to look at these last, after we've gotten a good understanding of all the pages. This way we can be sure if a component is actually re-used elsewhere.

In this app we've got the following shared components:

- header with search bar, and tag filtering.
- breadcrumbs for navigation.
- footer with a form to subscribe to a newsletter.

The header looks complicated, but might be key to the using the site. Breadcrumbs, and the newsletter sign-up seem like a nice-to-have, so I would ask which takes higher priority here.
